          Navigation apps pick the fastest road. They do not know that the road has a broken patch or an
          unmarked hump that will scrape a low car. RoadGuard looks at the actual road surface, through
          Google Street View, and rates each route for the vehicle you drive.

          <h3>What it detects</h3>
          <p>Potholes and speed breakers, using two YOLOv8 models fine-tuned on Indian road images. Each detection comes with its confidence and the frame it was seen in, so you can judge it yourself.</p>

          <h3>Why ground clearance</h3>
          <p>The same hump is harmless to an SUV at 200 mm and a problem for a sedan at 145 mm. Risk is scaled by the clearance of your vehicle, from lowered coupes up to off-roaders.</p>

        <div className="about-feature-card">
          <h3>Limits</h3>
          <p>Street View imagery can be years old and is missing on many small roads. Detections are automated and sometimes wrong. Treat the result as a heads-up, not a guarantee.</p>
